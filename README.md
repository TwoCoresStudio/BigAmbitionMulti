---

> **Beta release.** This is an early public beta — expect bugs. **Back up your single-player saves before using it.** Reporting problems is the whole point of this release; see [Reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs).

**Going Public** adds multiplayer to [Big Ambitions](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1331550/Big_Ambitions/). One player hosts a world and others join over the network to play in the same city — shopping in each other's stores, building competing business empires, and appearing on each other's rivals leaderboard, with a synchronized clock, shared world state, vehicles, and more.

## Requirements

- **Big Ambitions**, Early Access **0.11** (the Mono / "experimental" branch). The mod is built against 0.11.
- **Both players must run the same game version and the same mod version.** The mod checks this when you connect and refuses a mismatch (so an out-of-date build can't quietly desync a session).
- Uses the game's built-in mod loader — no third-party loader required.

## Installation

1. Download the `.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/Melaus123/BigAmbitionMulti/releases).
2. Extract it — you'll get a `BigAmbitionsMP` folder.
3. Copy that `BigAmbitionsMP` folder into your local mods folder:
   ```
   %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Hovgaard Games\Big Ambitions\ModsLocal\
   ```
   You should end up with `...\ModsLocal\BigAmbitionsMP\BigAmbitionsMP.dll`.
4. Launch the game, open the **Mods** menu, and enable **BigAmbitionsMP**.

Every player installs the same way.

## Hosting and joining

- One player **hosts**; the others **join** by entering the host's IP address (shown in the host's lobby).
- The default port is **7777 (UDP)**. The host needs that port reachable over the internet — forward it on the router, or use a virtual-network tool (ZeroTier, Radmin, Hamachi, etc.) so everyone connects as if on the same network.

## Reporting bugs

This beta exists to find bugs, so please report them. The easiest way is in-game: type **`/bug <what happened>`** in chat, or click **Report** in the chat window — it packages your logs and session details into a folder (and can upload them to Discord if a webhook is configured; your IP is stripped from uploads). You can also [open an issue](https://github.com/Melaus123/BigAmbitionMulti/issues) with:

- What happened and what you expected.
- Whether you were the **host** or a **client**.
- The log file from **both** machines:
  ```
  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Hovgaard Games\Big Ambitions\Player.log
  ```

Maintainers can enable Discord forum uploads locally by editing the generated
`BigAmbitionsMP.cfg.<install>.json` in the mod folder. The webhook is deliberately
not committed to Git. Set `BugReportDiscordWebhookUrl`, `BugReportDiscordCrashTagId`,
and `BugReportDiscordBugTags` (`Label=tagId;Other=tagId`). If the forum requires
tags, leave `BugReportDiscordRequiresTags` set to `true`.

## Building from source

Requires the .NET SDK and a local Big Ambitions install (the project references the game's own assemblies). Build the shipping mod with `dotnet build -c Release`; run `package.ps1` to produce a distributable zip. A `dotnet build -c Dev` build re-enables developer/diagnostic tooling that the shipped build leaves out.
